# A project related to Chapter 7 of the textbook

The header file is the class of Lorenz system and the solver based on Runge-Kutta Methods.

The parameters of Lorenz system is based on the textbook, where sigma = 10, R = 28, b = 10/3. 

Data.dat is the numerical solution of Lorenz system.

I have used both Gnuplot and Matplotlib(Python) to plot the graph.
